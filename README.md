_Group Members: Emily Choi, Yuna Dodobara, Leo Li, Sohshun Tateishi, Trevor Wong_

## Project Description
### Target Audience:
Our application provides budgeting resources to people who want to budget but don’t know how to do it properly; or alternatively, budget aware individuals who want to have an easier budgeting experience and want to compare their budget alongside other users. As it stands, nearly 30% of Americans don’t budget — and we’d like to provide tools to help that 30% and even the other 70% with budget builders, connections with other budgeters, and other useful tools in the form of a web app.

### Why would they use it:
The Budget Buddy web app would provide our users with the necessary tools to budget with zero financial background; perhaps even educating those potential users more about how budgeting works throughout the process. In using a web app that they can save their budgeting information by logging into an account, we create a tool that they can use at their own convenience without worrying about their data being entered as a one-time generation. Users can come back to the app whenever they want to view and update their information for their own benefit.

### Why as developers do we want to make this:
Our ambition to create this budget buddy web app stems from our past experience— most of us are in/have taken FIN 205 (Personal Finance) and we learned that budgeting is a powerful tool for people to use when planning their financial futures. Budgeting isn’t just preparing users to be financially independent, it extends to defining a person's future whether it be financially or it be in their character as a person. We wanted to create a platform where people can budget, learn, and grow alongside buddies.
